# simple6502 Firmware

This is a BIOS for the simple6502 SBC.

## Requirements

- Serial (ACIA): routines to initialize and manage the serial port.
- VIA helper routines to interface with a 6522 for I/O
- Memory Monitor: WozMon, why innovate?
- BASIC: will start with MS Basic from 1976 to be period correct and have Woz and Gates code in the same ROM
- Some LOAD/SAVE feature to put binaries in memory though serial for testing. Maybe as an updat eto WozMon??

Will come up with some other stuff with 32K I have space for stuff.
