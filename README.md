==========

My own take on a simple 6502 single board computer, inspired on Garth Wilson's excellent 6502 Primer, Daryl Rictor, Ben Eater, and my own beautiful C=64 and all the classic 8-bit computers of the late 70s early 80s.

This project exists because of scope creep on my YAsixfive02 project, which is in its 10000 iteration.
